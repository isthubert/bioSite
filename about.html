        <h2>Background</h2>

        <p>

            Gwendolyn was born and raised in central Florida, where she grew up surrounded by sunshine, strong values, and a large, loving family. As one of seven children, she learned early on the importance of togetherness, loyalty, and unconditional support. To this day, she treasures her siblings deeply and spends as much time with them as she can, keeping those lifelong bonds strong.
           Throughout her life, she has worked in various hotel restaurants, including several Disney resorts, where she refined her skills in hospitality and culinary service. Throughout the years, her talent for cooking became a love language. She expresses care, comfort, and connection through the meals she prepares, always finding joy in feeding others and bringing people together around the table.
           Family has always been at the center of her world. She believes the two strongest forces that create lasting bonds are food and faith. From hosting lively family parties to organizing meaningful holiday gatherings, she makes every occasion feel special and filled with warmth.
           Her faith has guided her since childhood. Instilled with strong church values at a young age, she has carried those morals into adulthood and passed them on to her children and anyone willing to listen. When she isn’t reading the Bible, she finds peace in painting. Though she has explored many creative outlets like sewing and crafts, painting remains the art form that truly soothes her spirit and allows her creativity to shine.

            My mother raised a loving family and taught us the value of <strong>fortitude</strong> and <strong>compassion</strong>.
